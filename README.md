# EfficiencyAnalysisOfDifferentSortingAlgorithms
In this program, I compare bubble sort, selection sort and insertion sort algorithms in terms of time complexity for best case scenarios (when array is already in ascending order), in average case scenario (when array is sorted in a random order) and in worst case scenarios (when array is in descending order and needs to be sorted in ascending order). This program executes all three sorting algorithms in best case, average case and worst case scenaios and prints the time taken to sort the array in a text file.
